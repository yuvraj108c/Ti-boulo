## 2. Description

### Overview

This application aims at curbing the rate of poverty by exploiting a potential market through a mobile application. The application presents people working low-paying jobs (Freelancer) with a platform to promote some of their skills and services. Potential employers (Hirer) will then contact freelancers they deem fit for their jobs and, following negotiations, will hire them.

## How it works

1. Users can register themselves as either **freelancer** or **hirer**
2. Users can upload details which are relevant to them - picture, bio, CV, etc
3. Users show interest in **categories**. When there are new tasks with categories relevant to a user, notifications can be displayed

### Hirer

1. These are the people who recruit others. They have a **task** to be done and need people to do it
2. They create tasks on which **freelancers** may work
3. They can also search for freelancers based on certain criteria

### Freelancer

1. **Freelancers** are the people looking for jobs
2. They can upload their CV, photos showcasing their past job and other details relevant to getting hired
3. They can browse tasks
4. They can show their interest in a task and negotiate with **hirers** about a task through the chat system

### Tasks

1. Tasks are whatever jobs a **hirer** requires **freelancer** to do
2. Tasks have an indication of where it will be carried out. It can be
a. inhome - the **freelancer** carries out the task where they deem fit
b. onpremise - the **freelancer** carries out the task at a site which the **hirer** decides
3. There are two pricing policies for tasks
a. fixed price - the **hirer** sets a fixed price for the whole task (the price can be modified later but it is set for the entirety of the task)
b. hourly - the **freelancer** is paid per hour. Some algorithms can be implemented in the app to determine for how long the **freelancer** stayed on the project.
